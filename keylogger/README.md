## Overview

During my internship at Albus Security, I had the opportunity to work on several interesting and challenging projects. Below are the details of one of the key projects I developed during my time here:

## Keylogger Script 

### Description:  
Developed a keylogger application using Python. The application captures keystrokes on the target system and stores them locally in a file for analysis.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- `pynput` library

### Features:
- Captures all keystrokes on the target system
- Stores keystrokes in a local file (`keylog.txt`)
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface
- Can run in the background on Linux/macOS

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- `pip` package manager to install dependencies

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the script files:**

    ```sh
    - git clone https://github.com/Vinayakgupta1/Albu_Sec_Intenship_Exploit-Dev_Project_Vinayak.git
    - cd Albu_Sec_Intenship_Exploit-Dev_Project_Vinayak
    cd keylogger.py
    ```


3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install the script:**

    ```sh
    python setup.py install
    ```

### Usage

#### Start the Keylogger

To start the keylogger, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
python keylogger.py
```
The __keylogger.py__ will begin recording keystrokes and save them to `keylog.txt` in the same directory.


## Viewing the Log File

The recorded keystrokes are saved in `keylog.txt`. To view the contents of this file, you can use any text editor or command-line tools.

#### Using a Text Editor

- **Windows**: Open `keylog.txt` with Notepad or any other text editor (e.g., Notepad++, VS Code).
- **macOS**: Open `keylog.txt` with TextEdit or any other text editor.
- **Linux**: Open `keylog.txt` with any text editor (e.g., gedit, nano, vim).

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

- **Consent**: Ensure you have explicit consent from anyone whose keystrokes you are logging.
- **Legal Use**: Ensure the use of this script complies with local laws and regulations. Unauthorized use of keylogging software is illegal and unethical.

## Example Workflow

1. **Run the Keylogger**:

    ```sh
    python keylogger.py
    ```

2. **Stop the Keylogger**:

    Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or Close the Terminal where the keylogger is running.

3. **View the Log File**:

    - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt and type:

        ```sh
        type keylog.txt
        ```

    - **macOS/Linux**: Open a terminal and type:

        ```sh
        cat keylog.txt
        ```

    or use any text editor to open the file.
