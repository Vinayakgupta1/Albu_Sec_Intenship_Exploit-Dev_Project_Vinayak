## API Detector Tool

### Objective :
The objective of API Detector tool is to detect leaked APIs, identify and monitor poetntial security vulnerabilities related to exposed or unintentionally leaked API keys.

### Key Usage :

- The primary purpose of an API leak detection tool is to identify instances where API keys have been inadvertently exposed or leaked.

- By continuously scanning for leaked API keys, organizations can maintain better security hygiene.

- Regular checks help prevent unauthorized access and potential breaches.

- Security researchers and bug bounty hunters use these tools to validate API keys found during security assessments.


### Benefits :

- Detecting and addressing API key leaks promptly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

- Protects sensitive data and prevents potential misuse.

- Prevents malicious actors from exploiting leaked keys.

- Helps organizations maintain trust with their users and clients.

## Keylogger Tool

### Objective :
The primary objective of keylogger tool is to silently record all keystrokes made on a computer system. It operates covertly, capturing input from the keyboard without the user's knowledge.

### Key Usage :

- Keyloggers are employed for security purposes to monitor user activity.

- During digital forensics investigations, keyloggers provide valuable evidence.

- Investigators analyze keystrokes to reconstruct user actions and identify patterns.

- Organizations use keyloggers to understand user behavior.

- Analyzing keystrokes aids in identifying common tasks, preferences, and potential risks.

### Benefits :

   - Keyloggers contribute to early threat detection.

   - Organizations use keyloggers to monitor employee activities.

   - Keyloggers assist in recovering lost or forgotten passwords.

   - Troubleshooters analyze keystrokes to identify issues or errors.
